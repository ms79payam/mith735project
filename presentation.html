  <p> Iran has a colorful history with rich premodern literature which goes back to over 1000 years. However, this literature has overshadowed the works of modern writers, and whereas Rumi and Omar Khayyam are world famous literary figures now, the modern poets, novelists, and dramatists are hardly known outside Persian speaking countries. In particular, drama has been absent even from the most acclaimed anthologies of modern Persian literature such as the PEN Anthology of Contemporary Iranian Literature (2006).
This research aims to show what a distant reading of 250 works of drama and narrative prose can reveal to us, and what the relationship of these works to their contemporary history is. In other words, we want to investigate how distant reading helps us to understand the relationship between modern Iranian history and literature. In pursuing that objective, we are going to mine the corpuses of 200 novels and 50 plays in the 20th and 21st century Persian literature. For our current study we have excluded short stories and prose narratives with less than 40,000 words. The electronic version of these 250 works has been prepared and needs to be changed into a machine-readable format. After the corpus is prepared, we will do content analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to study it, find the patterns, test the significance of the patterns, and finally analyze this significance in relation to their socio-political and historical context. In doing so, we will focus on the instances where literature and history share explicit historical overtones to see how modern Iranian history has influenced modern Persian literature.
This research can start a new path of inquiry for Iranian literature in the historical context by seeking to answer how the Iranian literati have responded to the historical events which have been unravelling at their own times, what historical events have had the biggest influences on the modern literature, what patterns of influence and relationship can emerge, and how we should interpret these patterns. This will be the first research in Persian literature which uses text mining to analyze the crossroads of history and literature in modern Iran. The findings of this enquiry will be further processed and visualized by graphs, charts, and maps. We intend to spend one month on cleaning up the data, then we will do the text mining and analyze the findings during the three months after. Finally, we will spend the next two months on visualization of the data.
